# useful_protein_tools
A list of useful webservers and tools that are relatively easy to use for protein analysis

1. **Seamdock** - super easy web server docking https://bioserv.rpbs.univ-paris-diderot.fr/services/SeamDock/ 

2. **CABS-flex2** - protein flexibility easily from PDB structures https://biocomp.chem.uw.edu.pl/CABSflex2 

3. **pubchem sketcher for chemical structures** https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//edit3/index.html

4. **Robetta fold** - super easy protein structure prediction but not as good as alphafold for monomers https://robetta.bakerlab.org/

5. **Expasy plot param** - gives lots of useful basic info about your protein e.g. MW, size, isoelectric point, amino acid composition, stability index etcâ€¦. https://web.expasy.org/cgi-bin/protparam/protparam

6. **Web server ramachandran plot** easy to use displays allowed/disallowed regions good as a sanity check for structures https://swift.cmbi.umcn.nl/servers/html/ramaplot.html

7. **Random sequence generator** https://www.bioinformatics.org/sms2/random_protein.html
